abstract = {Historically, access in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) has been conceptualized as the physical operation of AAC technologies; more recently, research and development in the cognitive and social sciences has helped to broaden the concept to include a range of human factors involved in the successful use of AAC technologies in social interactions. The goal of this article is to expand the current understanding of communication access by providing a conceptual framework for examining AAC access, evaluating recent scientific and technical advances in the areas of AAC, and discussing the challenges to accessing AAC technologies for a range of communication activities.},

abstract = {Increased communication rate has long been a goal of both individuals who use AAC and device manufacturers. There is evidence that utterance-based approaches have the potential to deliver faster rates without loss of coherence. An overview of the historical development of devices that embody such approaches is set out here. This account focuses on the theoretical origins of utterance-based devices (UBDs) and the range of approaches that these have produced. Next, the issue of a causal relationship between conversational rate and positive attributions is addressed. Three recent studies supporting a causal relationship are described, followed by an account of a direct comparison between a UBD and a word construction system in office environments that involved a mix of transactional communication and social chat. Conversational rate and perceived communicative competence were both higher when the UBD was used. Finally, some issues for the future development of UBDs are discussed.},

@article{Ghedira2009,
abstract = {For some people with motor disabilities and speech disorders, the only way to communicate and to have some control over their environment is through the use of a controlled scanning system operated by a single switch. The main problem with these systems is that the communication process tends to be exceedingly slow, since the system must scan through the available choices one at a time until the desired message is reached. One way of raising the speed of message selection is to optimize the elementary scanning delay in real time so that it allows the user to make selections as quickly as possible without making too many errors. With this objective in mind, this article presents a method for optimizing the scanning delay, which is based on an analysis of the data recorded in “log files” while applying the EDiTH system [Digital Teleaction Environment for People with Disabilities]. This analysis makes it possible to develop a human-machine interaction model specific to the study, and then to establish an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of the scanning delay. The results obtained with imposed scenarios and then in ecological situations provides a confirmation that our algorithms are effective in dynamically adapting a scan speed. The main advantage offered by the procedure proposed is that it works on timing information alone and thus does not require any knowledge of the scanning device itself. This allows it to work with any scanning device.Ghedira, S., Pino, P., {\&} Bourhis, G. (2009). Conception and Experimentation of a Communication Device with Adaptive Scanning. ACM Trans. Access.

abstract = {People with severe motor disabilities have extreme access difficulties with all kinds of web services especially when they want not only to surf the web, but also write some text, e.g., to participate in an e-activity. Several problems arise when using traditional scanning systems, such as the low text entry rate, the time consuming task of learning the scan matrix layout, or simply, the poor visibility of the web page due to the large surface needed to display the complete scan matrix on the screen. We propose a reduced virtual keyboard based on scanning with only one switch as input device. The scan matrix consists of only three cells, so ambiguity is present due to the assignment of 26 characters to the three keys. Word-level and character-level disambiguation modes are explored using a mathematical model, and the text entry rates for an expert user were 15.9 and 10.3 words per minute respectively, using a scan period of 0.5 seconds. This keyboard could be embedded into a web page using a Java applet, JavaScript code or a Flash application, or be programmed as an independent application.},

abstract = {A new one-key text entry method is presented. {\{}SAK{\}}, for "scanning ambiguous keyboard", combines one-key physical input (including error correction) with three virtual letter keys and a {\{}SPACE{\}} key. The virtual letter keys are highlighted in sequence ("scanned") and selected when the key bearing the desired letter receives focus. There is only one selection per letter. Selecting {\{}SPACE{\}} transfers scanning to a word-selection region, which presents a list of candidate words. A novel feature of {\{}SAK{\}} is multiple-letter-selection in a single scanning interval. In an evaluation with 12 participants, average entry speeds reached 5.11 wpm (all trials, 99{\%} accuracy) or 7.03 wpm (error-free trials). A modification using "timer restart on selection" allowed for more time and more selections per scanning interval. One participant performed extended trials (5 blocks x 5 phrases/block) with the modification and reached an average entry speed of 9.28 wpm.},

This research proposes a novel alternative to assign letters to keys, where letters with similar graphical characteristics are grouped into the same key, leading to families of four, three and two-key simple and easy-to-learn layouts. All layouts have been analyzed for a scanning system that implements a word and a character disambiguation algorithm using only one switch as input device. With the best three-key layout, the text entry speeds predicted were 16.7 wpm using word disambiguation and 10.8 wpm for character disambiguation, with a 0.5 seconds scan period. In an experiment conducted with 6 participants and dynamic scan period, average entry speeds reached 12.2 and 6.3 wpm respectively.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: . Some noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) systems are currently available for locked-in syndrome (LIS) but none have incorporated a statistical language model during text generation. OBJECTIVE: . To begin to address the communication needs of individuals with LIS using a noninvasive BCI that involves rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) of symbols and a unique classifier with electroencephalography (EEG) and language model fusion. METHODS: . The RSVP Keyboard was developed with several unique features. Individual letters are presented at 2.5 per second. Computer classification of letters as targets or nontargets based on EEG is performed using machine learning that incorporates a language model for letter prediction via Bayesian fusion enabling targets to be presented only 1 to 4 times. Nine participants with LIS and 9 healthy controls were enrolled. After screening, subjects first calibrated the system, and then completed a series of balanced word generation mastery tasks that were designed with 5 incremental levels of difficulty, which increased by selecting phrases for which the utility of the language model decreased naturally. RESULTS: . Six participants with LIS and 9 controls completed the experiment. All LIS participants successfully mastered spelling at level 1 and one subject achieved level 5. Six of 9 control participants achieved level 5. CONCLUSIONS: . Individuals who have incomplete LIS may benefit from an EEG-based BCI system, which relies on EEG classification and a statistical language model. Steps to further improve the system are discussed.},

The lack of standard metrics precludes the comparison of different BCI-based AAC systems, hindering rapid growth and development of this technology. This paper presents a review of the metrics that have been used to report performance of BCIs used for AAC from January 2005 to January 2012. We distinguish between Level 1 metrics used to report performance at the output of the BCI Control Module, which translates brain signals into logical control output, and Level 2 metrics at the Selection Enhancement Module, which translates logical control to semantic control. We recommend that: (1) the commensurate metrics Mutual Information or Information Transfer Rate (ITR) be used to report Level 1 BCI performance, as these metrics represent information throughput, which is of interest in BCIs for AAC; 2) the BCI-Utility metric be used to report Level 2 BCI performance, as it is capable of handling all current methods of improving BCI performance; (3) these metrics should be supplemented by information specific to each unique BCI configuration; and (4) studies involving Selection Enhancement Modules should report performance at both Level 1 and Level 2 in the BCI system. Following these recommendations will enable efficient comparison between both BCI Control and Selection Enhancement Modules, accelerating research and development of BCI-based AAC systems.},

abstract = {This study analyzes user performance of text entry tasks with word prediction by applying modeling techniques developed in the field of human-computer interaction. Fourteen subjects transcribed text with and without a word prediction feature for seven test sessions. Eight subjects were able-bodied and used mouthstick typing, while six subjects bad high-level spinal cord injuries and used their usual method of keyboard access. Use of word prediction decreased text generation rate for the spinal cord injured subjects and only modestly enhanced it for the able-bodied subjects. This suggests that the cognitive cost of using word prediction had a major impact on the performance of these subjects. Performance was analyzed in more detail by deriving subjects' times for keypress and list search actions during word prediction use. All subjects had slower keypress times during word prediction use as compared to letters-only typing, and spinal cord injured subjects had much slower list search times than able-bodied subjects. These parameter values were used in a two-parameter model to simulate subjects' word entry times during word prediction use, with an average model error of 16{\%}. These simulation results are an encouraging first step toward demonstrating the ability of analytical models to represent user performance with word prediction},

abstract = {Many persons with disabilities lack the fine motor coordination necessary to operate traditional keyboards. For these individuals, ambiguous (or reduced) keyboards offer an alternative access method. By placing multiple characters on each key, the size and accessibility of the individual keys can be enhanced without requiring a larger keyboard. Using statistical disambiguation algorithms to automatically interpret each keystroke, these systems can approach the keystroke efficiency (keystrokes per character) of conventional keyboards. Since the placement of characters on each key determines the effectiveness of these algorithms, several methods of optimizing keyboard arrangements have previously been proposed. This paper presents a new method for optimizing an arbitrary set of N characters over a collection of M keys. While earlier efforts relied upon approximations of keystroke efficiency, the proposed approach optimizes the arrangement under this exact performance measure. Applied to the canonical 26 characters on a nine-key "telephone keypad" problem, this method provides an improvement in efficiency of 2.5 percentage points over previously established layouts. Using only a minimum of calculations, the proposed technique operates quickly and efficiently, deriving optimal arrangements in a matter of seconds using a personal computer. The flexible method is applicable to arbitrary disambiguation algorithms, character sets, and languages.},

It is frequently used to input messages into communication systems, such as text-to-voice translators in order to maintain conversations. Nevertheless, the rate of text production usually obtained is very slow. For this reason, every effort to save time and optimize communication speed is welcome. In this way, this paper presents a study on the influence on the character input rate of diverse parameters related to the matrix that contains the selection set, such as shape, size, number of dimensions and layout of the selectable items. Its purpose is to extract a set of guidelines to design efficient input systems well adapted to the user, based on the scanning of items and its selection by means of one switch or push-button.},

However, to be useful and authentic, a systematic and principled approach to collecting, analyzing, and reporting case data must be observed. This paper proposes a basic case study format for documenting augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention to ensure reliable and valid measurement of performance and outcomes for evidence-based practice. An example case study of an adult with cerebral palsy who relies on AAC is presented to show how the principles of evidence-based practice (EBP) and performance measurement were applied to the AAC assessment process. AAC service delivery requires performance and outcomes measurement to lead to effective communication and improved quality of life. Reliable and validated methods of reporting data allow for consistency and the comparison of performance and outcome measures so decisions are not based on impressions of effectiveness, but actual results.},

Prediction systems are traditionally used by people with disabilities (e.g. people with motor and speech impairments). However, new applications, such as writing short text messages via mobile phones, have recently appeared. A vast amount of heterogeneous text prediction methods and techniques can be found in literature. Their heterogeneity makes it difficult to understand and compare them, in order to select the most convenient technique for a specific design. This paper presents a survey on text prediction techniques with the intention to provide a systematic view of this field. Prediction applications and related features, such as block size, dictionary structure, prediction method, user interface, etc., are examined. In addition, prediction measurement parameters and published results are compared. A large number of factors that may influence prediction results, including the acceptance of the system by the users, are reviewed, and their influence on the performance and usability of the system is discussed.},

abstract = {A significant barrier to evidence-based practice in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is the lack of validated performance measures that can be used by speech-language pathologists and rehabilitation engineers to evaluate the communication and device use of AAC consumers. Recently an effort has been made to develop automated data-logging techniques to facilitate the transcription and analysis of the AAC speaker's device use. A major source of error for the automated measurement of communication rate is the presence of excessive Inter-Selection Intervals (ISIs) (i.e., pause times), for which no communicative activity is occurring. The goal of this study was to develop an automated technique to filter out extreme ISIs, while preserving true communication rate performance. AAC data log files were obtained from seven individuals participating in a 1-month field trial of an AAC technology. Two temporal filtering techniques (arbitrary and individual) were compared for their ability to eliminate excessive ISIs. Results indicated that use of an individualized temporal filter was more sensitive to performance variability than use of an arbitrary temporal filter. Further, the individualized temporal filter elevated the participants' communication rate (measured by words per minute) by a factor of 1.8 to 34.5 greater than that of the unfiltered communication rate estimate. In addition, the first AAC communication rate performance estimates taken from the field are presented. Implications for further research and the valid use of automated data logging and analysis are discussed.},

The NavChair is based on a commercial wheelchair system with the addition of a DOS-based computer system, ultrasonic sensors, and an interface module interposed between the joystick and power module of the wheelchair. The obstacle avoidance routines used by the NavChair in conjunction with the ultrasonic sensors are modifications of methods originally used in mobile robotics research. The NavChair currently employs three operating modes: general obstacle avoidance, door passage, and automatic wall following. Results from performance testing of these three operating modes demonstrate their functionality. In additional to advancing the technology of smart wheelchairs, the NavChair has application to the development and testing of “shared control” systems where a human and machine share control of a system and the machine can automatically adapt to human behaviors},

abstract = {CONTEXT/OBJECTIVE: This study describes research behind two software wizards that help users with physical impairments adjust their keyboard and mouse settings to meet their specific needs. The Keyboard Wizard and Pointing Wizard programs help ensure that keyboard and pointing devices are properly configured for an individual, and reconfigured as the user's needs change. We summarize four effectiveness studies and six usability studies. METHODS: Studies involved participants whose physical impairments affect their ability to use a keyboard and mouse. Effectiveness studies used an A-B-A design, with condition A using default Windows settings and condition B using wizard-recommended settings. Primary data were performance metrics for text entry and target acquisition. Usability studies asked participants to run through each wizard, with no outside guidance. Primary data were completion time, errors made, and user feedback. RESULTS: The wizards were effective at recommending new settings for users who needed them and not recommending them for users who did not. Sensitivity for StickyKeys, pointer speed, and object size algorithms was 100{\%}. Specificity for StickyKeys and pointer speed was over 80{\%}, and 50{\%} for object size. For those who needed settings changes, the recommendations improved performance, with speed increases ranging from 9 to 59{\%}. Accuracy improved significantly with the wizard recommendations, eliminating up to 100{\%} of errors. Users ran through the current wizard software in less than 6 minutes. Ease-of-use rating averaged over 4.5 on a scale of 1 to 5. CONCLUSION: The wizards are a simple yet effective way of adjusting Windows to accommodate physical impairments.},

abstract = {The precise role of the cortex in human anxiety is not well characterised. Previous imaging research among healthy controls has reported alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) within the prefrontal and temporal cortices during periods of anxious anticipation; however, the temporal dynamics of this activity has yet to be examined in detail. The present study examined cortical Steady State Probe Topography (SSPT) changes associated with anticipatory anxiety (AA), allowing examination of the temporal continuity and the excitatory or inhibitory nature of AA activations. We recorded Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) at 64 scalp locations, skin conductance, and self reported anxiety among 26 right-handed males while relaxed and during the anticipation of an electric shock. Relative to the baseline condition, the AA condition was associated with significantly higher levels of self-reported anxiety and increased phasic skin conductance levels. Across the seven second imaging window, AA was associated with increased SSVEP latency within medial anterior frontal, left dorsolateral prefrontal and bilateral temporal regions. In contrast, increased SSVEP amplitude and decreased SSVEP latency were observed within occipital regions. The observed SSVEP latency increases within frontal and temporal cortical regions are suggestive of increased localised inhibitory processes within regions reciprocally connected to subcortical limbic structures. Occipital SSVEP latency decreases are suggestive of increased excitatory activity. SSVEP amplitude increases within occipital regions may be associated with an attentional shift from external to internal environment. The current findings provide further support for the involvement of frontal, anterior temporal, and occipital cortical regions during anticipatory anxiety, and suggest that both excitatory and inhibitory processes are associated with AA alterations.},

Studies of binary SSVEP-BCIs have been presented without the need of gazing at the expense of low performance. This study presents a high performance binary SSVEP-BCI that allows an efficient communication without the need of gazing. The information transmission rate (ITR) obtained was 0.64±0.27 bits per seconds with peaks of 1.16 bits per second and an accuracy of 90±7{\%}, which is an excellent performance for a binary SSVEP-BCI. To achieve this performance two main factors were involved: on the one hand, the use of both amplitude and phase of the SSVEP in the classification and, on the other, the use of the absence of gaze (“thousand-yard stare”) as a way of helping to ignore the stimulus.},

Recently, in engineering, SSVEPs found a novel application for SSVEP-driven brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Although some SSVEP properties are well documented, many questions are still hotly debated. We provide an overview of recent SSVEP studies in neuroscience (using implanted and scalp EEG, fMRI, or PET), with the perspective of modern theories about the visual pathway. We investigate the steady-state evoked activity, its properties, and the mechanisms behind SSVEP generation. Next, we describe the SSVEP-BCI paradigm and review recently developed SSVEP-based BCI systems. Lastly, we outline future research directions related to basic and applied aspects of SSVEPs.},

The BCI is based on steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEP) and the stimuli flickering are performed at high frequency (37, 38, 39 and 40 Hz). This high frequency stimulation scheme can reduce or even eliminate visual fatigue, allowing the user to achieve a stable performance for long term BCI operation. The BCI system uses power-spectral density analysis associated to three bipolar electroencephalographic channels. As the results show, 2 subjects were reported as SSVEP-BCI illiterates (not able to use the BCI), and, consequently, 13 subjects (12 of them healthy) could navigate the wheelchair in a room with obstacles arranged in four distinct configurations. Volunteers expressed neither discomfort nor fatigue due to flickering stimulation. A transmission rate of up to 72.5 bits/min was obtained, with an average of 44.6 bits/min in four trials. These results show that people could effectively navigate a robotic wheelchair using a SSVEP-based BCI with high frequency flickering stimulation.},

abstract = {In the present study, we introduce a new dual-frequency stimulation method that can produce more visual stimuli with limited number of stimulation frequencies for use in multiclass steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Methods for increasing the number of visual stimuli are necessary, particularly for the implementation of multi-class SSVEP-based BCI, as available stimulation frequencies are generally limited when visual stimuli are presented through a computer monitor. The new stimulation was based on a conventional black-white checkerboard pattern; however, unlike the conventional approach, ten visual stimuli eliciting distinct SSVEP responses at different frequencies could be generated by combining four different stimulation frequencies. Through the offline experiments conducted with eleven participants, we confirmed that all ten visual stimuli could evoke distinct and discriminable single SSVEP peaks, of which the signal-to-noise ratios were high enough to be used for practical SSVEP-based BCI systems. In order to demonstrate the possibility of the practical use of the proposed method, a mental keypad system was implemented and online experiments were conducted with additional ten participants. We achieved an average information transfer rate of 33.26 bits/min and an average accuracy of 87.23{\%}, and all ten participants succeeded in calling their mobile phones using our online BCI system.},

abstract = {Hybrid brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are representing a recent approach to develop practical BCIs. In such a system disabled users are able to use all their remaining functionalities as control possibilities in parallel with the BCI. Sometimes these people have residual activity of their muscles. Therefore, in the presented hybrid BCI framework we want to explore the parallel usage of electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) activity, whereby the control abilities of both channels are fused. Results showed that the participants could achieve a good control of their hybrid BCI independently of their level of muscular fatigue. Thereby the multimodal fusion approach of muscular and brain activity yielded better and more stable performance compared to the single conditions. Even in the case of an increasing muscular fatigue a good control (moderate and graceful degradation of the performance compared to the non-fatigued case) and a smooth handover could be achieved. Therefore, such systems allow the users a very reliable hybrid BCI control although they are getting more and more exhausted or fatigued during the day.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP) is a visual cortical response evoked by repetitive stimuli with a light source flickering at frequencies above 4 Hz and could be classified into three ranges: low (up to 12 Hz), medium (12-30) and high frequency ({\textgreater} 30 Hz). SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are principally focused on the low and medium range of frequencies whereas there are only a few projects in the high-frequency range. However, they only evaluate the performance of different methods to extract SSVEP.

METHODS: This research proposed a high-frequency SSVEP-based asynchronous BCI in order to control the navigation of a mobile object on the screen through a scenario and to reach its final destination. This could help impaired people to navigate a robotic wheelchair. There were three different scenarios with different difficulty levels (easy, medium and difficult). The signal processing method is based on Fourier transform and three EEG measurement channels.

RESULTS: The research obtained accuracies ranging in classification from 65{\%} to 100{\%} with Information Transfer Rate varying from 9.4 to 45 bits/min.

CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method allows all subjects participating in the study to control the mobile object and to reach a final target without prior training.},

@article{Klimesch2007,
abstract = {The traditional view holds that event-related potentials (ERPs) reflect fixed latency, fixed polarity evoked responses that appear superimposed on the 'background EEG'. The validity of the evoked model has been questioned by studies arguing that ERPs are generated at least in part by a reset of ongoing oscillations. But a proof of phase reset that is distinct from the 'artificial' influence of evoked components on EEG phase-has been proven difficult for a variety of methodological reasons. We argue that a theoretical analysis of the assumptions and empirical evaluation of predictions of the evoked and oscillatory ERP model offer a promising way to shed new light on mechanisms generating ERPs that goes well beyond attempts to prove phase reset. Research on EEG oscillations documents that oscillations are task relevant and show a common operating principle, which is the control of the timing of neural activity. Both findings suggest that phase reorganization of task relevant oscillations is a theoretical necessity. We further argue and show evidence that (i) task relevant oscillations exhibit a typical interactive and task relevant relationship between pre- and poststimulus power in the theta and alpha frequency range in a way that small prestimulus power is related to large poststimulus power and vice versa, (ii) ERP (interpeak) latencies and (iii) ERP amplitudes reflect frequency characteristics of alpha and theta oscillations. We emphasize that central assumptions of the evoked model cannot be substantiated and conclude that the ERPR model offers a new way for an integrative interpretation of ongoing and event-related EEG phenomena.},

abstract = {This study pursues the optimization of the brain responses to small reversing patterns in a Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) paradigm, which could be used to maximize the efficiency of applications such as Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). We investigated the SSVEP frequency response for 32 frequencies (5-84 Hz), and the time dynamics of the brain response at 8, 14 and 28 Hz, to aid the definition of the optimal neurophysiological parameters and to outline the onset-delay and other limitations of SSVEP stimuli in applications such as our previously described four-command BCI system. Our results showed that the 5.6-15.3 Hz pattern reversal stimulation evoked the strongest responses, peaking at 12 Hz, and exhibiting weaker local maxima at 28 and 42 Hz. After stimulation onset, the long-term SSVEP response was highly non-stationary and the dynamics, including the first peak, was frequency-dependent. The evaluation of the performance of a frequency-optimized eight-command BCI system with dynamic neurofeedback showed a mean success rate of 98{\%}, and a time delay of 3.4s. Robust BCI performance was achieved by all subjects even when using numerous small patterns clustered very close to each other and moving rapidly in 2D space. These results emphasize the need for SSVEP applications to optimize not only the analysis algorithms but also the stimuli in order to maximize the brain responses they rely on.},

@article{Brunner2010,
abstract = {In a conventional brain-computer interface (BCI) system, users perform mental tasks that yield specific patterns of brain activity. A pattern recognition system determines which brain activity pattern a user is producing and thereby infers the user's mental task, allowing users to send messages or commands through brain activity alone. Unfortunately, despite extensive research to improve classification accuracy, BCIs almost always exhibit errors, which are sometimes so severe that effective communication is impossible. We recently introduced a new idea to improve accuracy, especially for users with poor performance. In an offline simulation of a "hybrid" BCI, subjects performed two mental tasks independently and then simultaneously. This hybrid BCI could use two different types of brain signals common in BCIs - event-related desynchronization (ERD) and steady-state evoked potentials (SSEPs). This study suggested that such a hybrid BCI is feasible. Here, we re-analyzed the data from our initial study. We explored eight different signal processing methods that aimed to improve classification and further assess both the causes and the extent of the benefits of the hybrid condition. Most analyses showed that the improved methods described here yielded a statistically significant improvement over our initial study. Some of these improvements could be relevant to conventional BCIs as well. Moreover, the number of illiterates could be reduced with the hybrid condition. Results are also discussed in terms of dual task interference and relevance to protocol design in hybrid BCIs.},

A non-invasive BCI can allow the direct communication between humans and computers by analyzing electrical brain activity, recorded at the surface of the scalp with electroencephalography. The main purpose for BCIs is to enable communication for people with severe disabilities. Spelling is one of the first BCI application, it corresponds to the main communication mean for people who are unable to speak. While spelling can be the most basic application it remains a benchmark for communication applications and one challenge in the BCI community for some patients. This paper proposes a review of the current main strategies, and their limitations, for spelling words. It includes recent BCIs based on P300, steady-state visual evoked potentials and motor imagery. By considering some challenges in BCI spellers and virtual keyboards, some pragmatic issues are pointed out to eliminate false hopes about BCI for both disabled and healthy people.},

Given a limit N to the number of units the user and device can accommodate, and the type of language system desired (phoneme sequences, letter se- quences, or words with letters), the procedure produces sets of units that require a minimum number of selections per word of message. One nonvocal individual trained in a system of this type (N = 400 phoneme sequences) improved communication rate by 30{\%} over an alphabet system, despite a manual selection rate that was twice as slow with the large unit set.

Automatic evaluation of designs will be helpful to designers in making the appropriate design choice. In this paper, we present performance models for virtual scanning keyboards that can be used for automatic evaluation.

abstract = {In India, the population with severe neuro-motor impairments (like people suffering from cerebral palsy) faces an acute problem with electronic-learning because there is a dearth of quality learning aids available for them. By quality learning aids we mean certain softwares that can help this section of special users to learn fast and at the same time with ease. Though similar systems are available in the international market, all of such products have a cost ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. For an average Indian user, they are too costly to afford. Moreover these products come in foreign languages which cannot facilitate the learning of the Indian languages. Keeping these two problems in focus, we have tried to design and develop a few learning aids which helps these section of users to learn and that too in their own languages. All these tools are indigenous and at the same time available at an affordable price. In this paper we would discuss about a predictive virtual keyboard, which not only helps these users to learn typing but also helps them to write essays, letters, and even compose poetry. All of these they can do in their own language.},

abstract = {Virtual scanning keyboards are augmentative communication systems used by people with speech and motor impairments. Each of these systems consists of (a) a virtual keyboard and (b) a scanning input method. Designers of these systems need to choose from a large number of design alternatives, which requires evaluating alternate designs. Evaluation of alternate virtual scanning keyboard designs with disabled users is problematic due to the difficulties in (a) getting sufficient number of users for evaluation, particularly in countries like India where social conditions prevent many potential users from participating in the design process and (b) collecting sufficiently large data for analysis due to users' physical disabilities. The problems can be alleviated with the use of model based design methods. In model based design, models of user performance are employed to evaluate designs automatically, thus reducing the need for extensive user testing. Existing performance models of motion impaired users, however, do not consider scanning input methods. This limits the applicability of the existing models to the design of virtual scanning keyboards. To address the limitation, we developed performance models of virtual scanning keyboards. The models are validated by comparing the model predictions with results from user trials. Development and validation of the performance models are described in this paper.},

abstract = {—Although noninvasive brain–computer interfaces (BCI) based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been studied increasingly over the recent decades, their performance is still limited in two important aspects. First, the difficulty of per- forming a reliable detection ofBCIcommandsincreaseswhenEEG epoch length decreases, which makes high information transfer rates difficult to achieve. Second, the BCI system often misclas- sifies the EEG signals as commands, although the subject is not performing any task. In order to circumvent these limitations, the hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain during stimulation with steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were measured us- ing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) simultaneously with EEG. BCI commands were estimated based on responses to a flickering checkerboard (ON-period). Furthermore, an “idle” command was generated from the signal recorded by the NIRS system when the checkerboard was not flickering (OFF-period). The joint use of EEG and NIRS was shown to improve the SSVEP classification. For 13 subjects, the relative improvement in error rates obtained by using theNIRSsignal, for nine classes including the “idle”mode, ranged from 85{\%} to 53{\%},whenthe epochlengthincreasefrom 3 to 12 s. These results were obtained from only one EEG and one NIRS channel. The proposed bimodal NIRS–EEG approach, in- cluding detection of the idle mode,may make current BCI systems faster and more reliable.},

abstract = {Eye-gaze tracking has been an important and interesting area of research for quite some time now. In laboratory experiments for psychological research, eye-gaze tracking constitutes a helpful tool to probe the perceptual or the cognitive processes of the subjects. In day-to-day applications, eye-gaze tracking can be used as a computer interface for both industrial and nonindustrial applications, which require hands-free installations. It can also be used to help disabled people to use computers for communication and for environmental control. This paper aims to develop a computer system to facilitate the study of visual scanning and eye fixation during image exploration. The system uses an infrared device to detect horizontal and vertical eye movements. This paper mainly focuses its attention on the calibration procedure that can be effectively utilized for correction of the nonlinearities in the oculomotor for the eyes of each individual subject. An adaptive calibration algorithm has been developed by employing a polynomial model. Several experiments have been carried out to demonstrate that the proposed approach is a rapid one and is accurate for the study of visual perception and recognition processes.},

abstract = {In animals, sodium- and calcium-mediated persistent inward currents (PICs), which produce long-lasting periods of depolarization under conditions of low synaptic drive, can be activated in trigeminal motoneurons following the application of the monoamine serotonin. Here we examined if PICs are activated in human trigeminal motoneurons during voluntary contractions and under physiological levels of monoaminergic drive (e.g., serotonin and norepinephrine) using a paired motor unit analysis technique. We also examined if PICs activated during voluntary contractions are larger in participants who demonstrate involuntary chewing during sleep (bruxism), which is accompanied by periods of high monoaminergic drive. In control participants, during a slowly increasing and then decreasing isometric contraction, the firing rate of an earlier-recruited masseter motor unit, which served as a measure of synaptic input to a later-recruited test unit, was consistently lower during derecruitment of the test unit compared with at recruitment ($\Delta$F = 4.6 ± 1.5 imp/s). The $\Delta$F, therefore, is a measure of the reduction in synaptic input needed to counteract the depolarization from the PIC to provide an indirect estimate of PIC amplitude. The range of $\Delta$F values measured in the bruxer participants during similar voluntary contractions was the same as in controls, suggesting that abnormally high levels of monoaminergic drive are not continually present in the absence of involuntary motor activity. We also observed a consistent "onion skin effect" during the moderately sized contractions ({\textless}20{\%} of maximal), whereby the firing rate of higher threshold motor units discharged at slower rates (by 4-7 imp/s) compared with motor units with relatively lower thresholds. The presence of lower firing rates in the more fatigue-prone, higher threshold trigeminal motoneurons, in addition to the activation of PICs, likely facilitates the activation of the masseter muscle during motor activities such as eating, nonnutritive chewing, clenching, and yawning.},

abstract = {Our objective was to develop and validate a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system suitable for long-term independent home use by people with severe motor disabilities. The BCI was used by a 51-year-old male with ALS who could no longer use conventional assistive devices. Caregivers learned to place the electrode cap, add electrode gel, and turn on the BCI. After calibration, the system allowed the user to communicate via EEG. Re-calibration was performed remotely (via the internet), and BCI accuracy assessed in periodic tests. Reports of BCI usefulness by the user and the family were also recorded. Results showed that BCI accuracy remained at 83{\%} (r = -.07, n.s.) for over 2.5 years (1.4{\%} expected by chance). The BCI user and his family state that the BCI had restored his independence in social interactions and at work. He uses the BCI to run his NIH-funded research laboratory and to communicate via e-mail with family, friends, and colleagues. In addition to this first user, several other similarly disabled people are now using the BCI in their daily lives. In conclusion, long-term independent home use of this BCI system is practical for severely disabled people, and can contribute significantly to quality of life and productivity.},

abstract = {People with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PwALS) show progressive loss of voluntary muscle strength. In advanced disease, motor and phonatory impairments seriously hinder the patient's interpersonal communication. High-tech devices such as eye tracking communication devices (ETCDs) are used to aid communication in the later stages of ALS. We sought to evaluate the effect of ETCDs on patient disability, quality of life (QoL), and user satisfaction, in a group of 35 regular ETCD users in late-stage ALS with tetraplegia and anarthria. The following scales were administered: 1) the Individually Prioritized Problem Assessment (IPPA) scale, in three conditions: without device, with ETCD and, when applicable, with an Eye Transfer (ETRAN) board; 2) the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS); and 3) the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0). With ETRAN, IPPA showed an increase in communicative abilities with respect to the condition without device, but ETCD produced a further significant increase. PIADS evidenced a large increase of QoL, and QUEST 2.0 showed high user satisfaction with ETCD use. In conclusion, ETCDs should be considered in late-stage ALS with tetraplegia and anarthria, since in these patients they can reduce communication disability and improve QoL.},

abstract = {The assessment of psychological morbidity in patients with ALS has centered around depression, hopelessness, and anxiety. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) offers an opportunity to explore psychological morbidity more broadly. We administered this instrument to 111 patients with ALS as part of a larger study of quality of life. Scores of ALS patients on the Global Severity Index and Positive Symptom Distress Index were comparable to the majority of distressed psychiatric outpatients and significantly higher than those of non-patient adults. Among BSI subscales, scores on the Anxiety, Depression, Phobic Anxiety, and Somatization subscales also were not significantly different from distressed adult psychiatric outpatients, and were greater than normal mean scores for a non-patient population sample. Based on these data, ALS patients appear to be significantly more distressed than non-patients in the identified areas, and as distressed as approximately 68{\%} of a distressed psychiatric outpatient sample. In conclusion, a substantial number of individuals with ALS experience psychological distress of various types. Because psychological health impacts lifespan and quality of life in these individuals, broadly-based mental health assessment and treatment should remain an important part of care for patients with ALS. The effects of physical symptoms on responses to questions used to assess psychological distress must be considered.},

Therefore the objective of the current study is to determine the opinions and priorities of people with ALS regarding BCI design. This information will guide BCIs in development to meet end-user needs. A telephone survey was undertaken of 61 people with ALS from the University of Michigan's Motor Neuron Disease Clinic. With regard to BCI design, participants prioritized accuracy of command identification of at least 90{\%} (satisfying 84{\%} of respondents), speed of operation comparable to at least 15-19 letters per minute (satisfying 72{\%}), and accidental exits from a standby mode not more than once every 2-4 h (satisfying 84{\%}). While 84{\%} of respondents would accept using an electrode cap, 72{\%} were willing to undergo outpatient surgery and 41{\%} to undergo surgery with a short hospital stay in order to obtain a BCI. In conclusion, people with ALS expressed a strong interest in obtaining BCIs, but current BCIs do not yet provide desired BCI performance.},

Design goals for a gaze-typing system are identified: productivity above 25 words per minute, robust tracking, high availability, and support of multimodal input. A detailed investigation of the efficiency and user satisfaction with a Danish and a Japanese gaze-typing system compares it to head- and mouse (hand) - typing. We found gaze typing to be more erroneous than the other two modalities. Gaze typing was just as fast as head typing, and both were slower than mouse (hand-) typing. Possibilities for design improvements are discussed.},

abstract = {Human-computer interactions (HCI) have become an important area of research and development in computer science and psychology. Appropriate use of computers could be of primary importance for communication and education of those subjects which could not move, speak, see or hear properly. The aim of our study was to develop a reliable, low-cost and easy-to-use HCI based on electrooculography signal analysis, to allow physically impaired patients to control a computer as assisted communication. Twenty healthy subjects served as volunteers: eye movements were captured by means of four electrodes and a two-channel amplifier. The output signal was then transmitted to an "Analog to Digital" (AD) converter, which digitized the signal of the amplifier at a rate of 500 Hz, before being sent to a laptop. We designed and coded a specific software, which analyzed the input signal to give an interpretation of eye movements. By means of a single ocular movement (up, down, left and right) the subjects were then able to move a cursor over a screen keyboard, passing from one letter to another; a double eye blink was then necessary to select and write the active letter. After a brief training session, all the subjects were able to confidently control the cursor and write words using only ocular movements and blinking. For each subject we presented three series of randomized words: mean time required to enter a single character was about 8.5s, while input errors were very limited (less than 1 per 250 characters). Our results confirm those obtained in previous studies: eye-movement interface can be used to properly control computer functions and to assist communication of movement-impaired patients.},

abstract = {The present review systematically examines the literature reporting gaze independent interaction modalities in non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication. BCIs measure signals related to specific brain activity and translate them into device control signals. This technology can be used to provide users with severe motor disability (e.g. late stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); acquired brain injury) with an assistive device that does not rely on muscular contraction. Most of the studies on BCIs explored mental tasks and paradigms using visual modality. Considering that in ALS patients the oculomotor control can deteriorate and also other potential users could have impaired visual function, tactile and auditory modalities have been investigated over the past years to seek alternative BCI systems which are independent from vision. In addition, various attentional mechanisms, such as covert attention and feature-directed attention, have been investigated to develop gaze independent visual-based BCI paradigms. Three areas of research were considered in the present review: (i) auditory BCIs, (ii) tactile BCIs and (iii) independent visual BCIs. Out of a total of 130 search results, 34 articles were selected on the basis of pre-defined exclusion criteria. Thirteen articles dealt with independent visual BCIs, 15 reported on auditory BCIs and the last six on tactile BCIs, respectively. From the review of the available literature, it can be concluded that a crucial point is represented by the trade-off between BCI systems/paradigms with high accuracy and speed, but highly demanding in terms of attention and memory load, and systems requiring lower cognitive effort but with a limited amount of communicable information. These issues should be considered as priorities to be explored in future studies to meet users' requirements in a real-life scenario.},

evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is
applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight

well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in

the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method

New statistics include a unified total error rate, combining two constituent error rates: the corrected error rate (errors committed but corrected) and the not corrected error rate (errors left in the transcribed text). The framework includes other measures including error correction efficiency, participant conscientiousness, utilised bandwidth, and wasted bandwidth.

Stimulus overselectivity is defined as an atypical limitation in the number of stimuli or stimulus features within an image that are attended to and subsequently learned. Within AAC, the term stimulus could refer to symbols or line drawings on speech-generating devices, drawings or pictures on low-technology systems, and/or the elements within visual scene displays. In this context, overselective attention may result in unusual or uneven error patterns such as confusion between two symbols that share a single feature, or difficulties with transitioning between different types of hardware. We review some of the ways that overselective attention has been studied behaviorally. We then examine how eye tracking technology allows a glimpse into some of the behavioral characteristics of overselective attention. We describe an intervention approach, differential observing responses, that may reduce or eliminate overselectivity, and we consider this type of intervention as it relates to issues of relevance for AAC.},

The system is intended to provide an alternate input modality to allow people with severe disabilities to access a computer. Voluntary long blinks trigger mouse clicks, while involuntary short blinks are ignored. The system enables communication using “blink patterns:” sequences of long and short blinks which are interpreted as semiotic messages. The second tool, “EyebrowClicker,” automatically detects when a user raises his or her eyebrows and then triggers a mouse click. Both systems can initialize themselves, track the eyes at frame rate, and recover in the event of errors. No special lighting is required. The systems have been tested with interactive games and a spelling program. Results demonstrate overall detection accuracy of 95.6{\%} for BlinkLink and 89.0{\%} for EyebrowClicker.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the prospects of psychology playing a significant role in the progress of human-computer interaction. In any field, hard science (science that is mathematical or otherwise technical) has a tendency to drive out softer sciences, even if the softer sciences have important contributions to make. It is possible that, as computer science and artificial intelligence contributions to human-computer interaction mature, this could happen to psychology. It is suggested that this trend might be prevented by hardening the applicable psychological science. This approach, however, has been critized on the grounds that the resulting body of knowledge would be too low level, too lim- ited in scope, too late to affect computer technology, and too difficult to apply. The prospects for overcoming each of these obstacles are analyzed here.},

abstract = {The locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a very severe condition caused by a primary vascular or traumatic injury to the brainstem, normally corresponding to a ventral pons lesion due to an obstruction of the basilar artery, and characterized by upper motor neuron quadriplegia, paralysis of lower cranial nerves, bilateral paresis of horizontal gaze and anarthria, and with preserved consciousness. Patients who have suffered this pontine lesion generally have preserved vertical eye movements and movement of the eyelids (blinking), this being their only means of responding to the outside world. A survey was conducted of 44 people diagnosed with LIS, all of them belonging to the Association of Locked-in Syndrome (ALIS) of France. Results of this survey showed that LIS was equally frequent in men and women (51.2{\%} vs. 48.1{\%}) and had occurred at any age between 22-77 years of age (normally between 41-52 years, the mean age being 46.79 years). The average time that transpired post-insult was 71.35 months. The principal cause of LIS was stroke (86.4{\%}), with traumatic brain injury (TBI) being a distant second cause with an incidence of only 13.6{\%}. The diagnosis of LIS was usually made around the middle of the second month after onset (mean of 78.76 days). The principal treatments, when present, were pharmacological and physiotherapy. However, 47.1{\%} of the patients were not receiving treatment of any kind at the time of the survey. Neuropsychologically, 86{\%} had a good attentional level, 97.6{\%} were temporally oriented and 76.7{\%} could read; 18.6{\%} reported memory problems and 24{\%} showed visual deficit (found mainly in patients with LIS originated by TBI); 47.5{\%} reported a good mood state and 12.5{\%} reported feeling depressed; 61.1{\%} reported having sexual desire, but only 30{\%} maintained sexual relations; 78{\%} were capable of emitting sounds and 65.8{\%} could communicate without technical aid; 73.2{\%} enjoyed going out and 81{\%} met with friends at least twice a month. Only 14.3{\%} participated in social activities and 23.8{\%} watched television regularly. Nearly 100{\%} of the patients reported being sensitive to touch to any part of their bodies. This survey suggests diagnostics and rehabilitation procedures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A major challenge in the management of severely brain-injured patients with altered states of consciousness is to estimate their residual perception of the environment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the integrity of detection of one's own name in patients in a behaviorally well-documented vegetative state (VS), patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS), and patients with locked-in syndrome. DESIGN: We recorded the auditory evoked potentials to the patient's own name and to 7 other equiprobable first names in 15 brain-damaged patients. RESULTS: A P3 component was observed in response to the patient's name in all patients with locked-in syndrome, in all MCS patients, and in 3 of 5 patients in a VS. P3 latency was significantly (P{\textless}.05) delayed for MCS and VS patients compared with healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that partially preserved semantic processing could be observed in noncommunicative brain-damaged patients, notably for the detection of salient stimuli, such as the subject's own name. This function seems delayed in MCS and (if present) in VS patients. More important, a P3 response does not necessarily reflect conscious perception and cannot be used to differentiate VS from MCS patients.},

Six cases were reported from our center and the remaining 133 cases were taken from a review of the literature. The results of this review emphasized the necessity for a comprehensive program of pulmonary management in this population. Furthermore, an effective system of communication for the patient is considered essential in the management of the "locked-in" state. Reported mortality in the cases reviewed was 60{\%}. Overall, the prognosis for survival and recovery was found to be better in the group of patients whose syndrome was nonvascular in origin than those with a vascular etiology. Functional recovery was generally good in those patients with a vascular etiology who survived beyond 4 months while recovery occurred earlier and more completely in the nonvascular group. Thus, a program of intensive rehabilitation should be considered early in both groups in order to assist each patient in attaining the highest level of function possible as recovery progresses.},

However, Universal Access is also about providing access to users in all situations and circumstances, including those that place extraordinary or unusual demands on the users who might otherwise not need assistance. This paper examines the design of a user interface (UI) for use in an airport environment and explains how the lessons learned from research into designing for users with disabilities, in particular, have been applied in this new context. The paper further describes a series of experiments that were performed to demonstrate the usability of the new interface and also compares the efficiency and effectiveness of three different input strategies developed for the new UI. The most efficient method of input was a strategy of combined keyboard shortcuts offering access to the full functionality of the UI. The case study also highlights that new Web 2.0 technologies support the implementation of accessibility solutions more typically only associated with non-Web applications. Further, it demonstrates that relying on only the TAB key for supporting keyboard-only access is comparatively inefficient, and that Web developers should be actively encouraged to use all of the available functionality from Web 2.0 technologies to produce more flexible and efficient keyboard-only support.},

They are used in a broad field of applications nowadays. One important issue is the control of neuroprosthetic devices for the restoration of the grasp function in spinal-cord-injured people. In this communication, an asynchronous (self-paced) four-class BCI based on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) was used to control a two-axes electrical hand prosthesis. During training, four healthy participants reached an online classification accuracy between 44{\%} and 88{\%}. Controlling the prosthetic hand asynchronously, the participants reached a performance of 75.5 to 217.5 s to copy a series of movements, whereas the fastest possible duration determined by the setup was 64 s. The number of false negative (FN) decisions varied from 0 to 10 (the maximal possible decisions were 34). It can be stated that the SSVEP-based BCI, operating in an asynchronous mode, is feasible for the control of neuroprosthetic devices with the flickering lights mounted on its surface.},

abstract = {This paper describes discriminative language modeling for a large vocabulary speech recognition task. We contrast two parameter estimation methods: the perceptron algorithm, and a method based on maximizing the regularized conditional log-likelihood. The models are encoded as deterministic weighted finite state automata, and are applied by intersecting the automata with word-lattices that are the output from a baseline recognizer. The perceptron algorithm has the benefit of automatically selecting a relatively small feature set in just a couple of passes over the training data. We describe a method based on regularized likelihood that makes use of the feature set given by the perceptron algorithm, and initialization with the perceptron's weights; this method gives an additional 0.5{\%} reduction in word error rate (WER) over training with the perceptron alone. The final system achieves a 1.8{\%} absolute reduction in WER for a baseline first-pass recognition system (from 39.2{\%} to 37.4{\%}), and a 0.9{\%} absolute reduction in WER for a multi-pass recognition system (from 28.9{\%} to 28.0{\%}). ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The two areas have generally been reported separately; but this book seeks to tie them together. For usability analysis, the user's eye movements while using the system are recorded and later analyzed retrospectively, but the eye movements do not affect the interface in real time. As a direct control medium, the eye movements are obtained and used in real time as an input to the user–computer dialogue. They might be the sole input, typically for disabled users or hands-busy applications, or they might be used as one of several inputs, combining with mouse, keyboard, sensors, or other devices.},

abstract = {Driver distraction and driver inattention are frequently recognized as leading causes of crashes and incidents. Despite this fact, there are few methods available for the automatic detection of driver distraction. Eye tracking has come forward as the most promising detection technology, but the technique suffers from quality issues when used in the field over an extended period of time. Eye-tracking data acquired in the field clearly differs from what is acquired in a laboratory setting or a driving simulator, and algorithms that have been developed in these settings are often unable to operate on noisy field data. The aim of this paper is to develop algorithms for quality handling and signal enhancement of naturalistic eye- and head-tracking data within the setting of visual driver distraction. In particular, practical issues are highlighted. Developed algorithms are evaluated on large-scale field operational test data acquired in the Sweden-Michigan Field Operational Test (SeMiFOT) project, including data from 44 unique drivers and more than 10 000 trips from 13 eye-tracker-equipped vehicles. Results indicate that, by applying advanced data-processing methods, sensitivity and specificity of eyes-off-road glance detection can be increased by about 10{\%}. In conclusion, postenhancement and quality handling is critical when analyzing large databases with naturalistic eye-tracking data. The presented algorithms provide the first holistic approach to accomplish this task.},

abstract = {This paper describes a method for the robust tracking of rigid
head motion from video. This method uses a 3D ellipsoidal model of the
head and interprets the optical flow in terms of the possible rigid
motions of the model. This method is robust to large angular and
translational motions of the head and is not subject to the
singularities of a 2D model. The method has been successfully applied to
heads with a variety of shapes, hair styles, etc. This method also has
the advantage of accurately capturing the 3D motion parameters of the
head. This accuracy is shown through comparison with a ground truth
synthetic sequence (a rendered 3D animation of a model head). In
addition, the ellipsoidal model is robust to small variations in the
initial fit, enabling the automation of the model initialization.
Lastly, due to its consideration of the entire 3D aspect of the head,
the tracking is very stable over a large number of frames. This
robustness extends even to sequences with very low frame rates and noisy
camera images},

abstract = {Recently, eye tracking technologies (i.e., technologies that automatically track the point of an individual's gaze while that person views or interacts with a visual image) have become available for research purposes. Based on the sampling of the orientation of the individual's eyes, researchers can quantify which locations within the visual image were fixated (viewed), for how long, and how many times. These automated eye tracking research technologies open up a wealth of avenues for investigating how individuals with developmental or acquired communication disabilities may respond to aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. In this paper, we introduce basic terminology and explore some of the special challenges of conducting eye tracking research with populations with disabilities who might use AAC, including challenges of inferring attention from the presence of fixation and challenges related to calibration that may result from participant characteristics, behavioral idiosyncracies, and/or the number of calibration points. We also examine how the technology can be applied to ask well-structured experimental questions that have direct clinical relevance, with a focus on the unique contributions that eye tracking research can provide by (a) allowing evaluation of skills in individuals who are difficult to assess via traditional methods, and (b) facilitating access to information on underlying visual cognitive processes that is not accessible via traditional behavioral measures.},

abstract = {This paper describes an original system to provide a communication and control tool for people who are disabled. The mechanomyogram (MMG) is used as a control signal to operate an alphabet board. The MMG is the mechanical signal observable at the surface of a muscle due to vibration of the motor units underneath. Contraction of the muscle increases the amplitude of the vibrations. The system described detects the MMG from either the biceps brachii or the sternocleidomastoid muscle using a dual-axis accelerometer. The signal is read into the computer and processed. A decision is made as to whether the muscle is contracted or relaxed based on the amplitude of the processed signal. If the computer decides that the muscle is contracted, a software switching action is performed. This switching action is used to control a software alphabet board which the disabled person can use to spell out messages.},

In this paper, Morse code is selected as a communication adaptive device for disabled persons who suffer from muscle atrophy, cerebral palsy or other severe handicaps. A stable typing rate is strictly required for Morse code to be effective as a communication tool. This restriction is a major hindrance. The proposed system uses support vector machines and the variable degree variable step size least-mean-square algorithm to achieve these objectives. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the proposed method elicited a recognition rate of as high as a 90{\%}.},

In situations of disease or trauma, there may be inability to communicate with others through means such as speech or typing. Eye movement tends to be one of the last remaining active muscle capabilities for people with neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Thus, there is a need for eye movement based systems to enable communication. To meet this need, we proposed a system to accept eye-gaze controlled navigation of a particular letter and EMG based click to enter the letter. Eye -gaze direction (angle) is obtained from EOG signals and EMG signal is recorded from eyebrow muscle activity. A virtual screen keyboard may be used to examine the usability of the proposed system.},

For applications of disabled person such as lock-in, and Motor Neuron disease, a simple and effective technology for communication is necessary. Eye blink is defined as a selection command in existing research. Problem of current research is occurred when user blinks his eye involuntarily. To resolve this problem, in this paper, we develop a new electrooculography based system for typing words via virtual keyboard by using voltage threshold algorithm. EOG signal with different direction of eye movement in horizontal and vertical directions are detected. EOG signal is measured by two channels with six electrodes. Measurement circuit consists of three major processes: instrument amplifier, filter and signal conditioning amplifier processes. These circuits filter noise out, pass frequencies in ranges of EOG signal and then amplify the signal. The voltage threshold algorithm is then used to classify the EOG signal. Selection command is defined by closing eye in a short period of use to avoid eye blink involuntary. To test the performance of method, typing rate and accuracy are measured. Typing rate on virtual keyboard 25.94 seconds/letter and its accuracy is 95.2{\%}. The results show the feasibility of proposed method.},

We analyze the effects of visual key layout to the performance of virtual keyboards in connection with the statistical properties of the target language's vocabulary.

shown that existing word-prediction technologies can be enhanced by
allowing prediction algorithms to take input from both ends of a

is also demonstrated that telecommunications may successfully generate
new word and phrase prediction strategies by allowing communication
partners at a remote site to aid an AAC user in the creation of a text

abstract = {Humans need communication. The desire to communicate remains one of the primary issues for people with locked-in syndrome (LIS). While many assistive and augmentative communication systems that use various physiological signals are available commercially, the need is not satisfactorily met. Brain interfaces, in particular, those that utilize event related potentials (ERP) in electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the intent of a person noninvasively, are emerging as a promising communication interface to meet this need where existing options are insufficient. Existing brain interfaces for typing use many repetitions of the visual stimuli in order to increase accuracy at the cost of speed. However, speed is also crucial and is an integral portion of peer-to-peer communication; a message that is not delivered timely often looses its importance. Consequently, we utilize rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in conjunction with language models in order to assist letter selection during the brain-typing process with the final goal of developing a system that achieves high accuracy and speed simultaneously. This paper presents initial results from the RSVP Keyboard system that is under development. These initial results on healthy and locked-in subjects show that single-trial or few-trial accurate letter selection may be possible with the RSVP Keyboard paradigm.},

abstract = {In line with the mission of the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (ATA), this study proposes an integrated assistive real-time system which "affirms that technology is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the lives of people with disabilities." An assistive technology device is defined by the ATA as "any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities." The purpose of this study is to design and develop an alternate input device that can be used even by individuals with severe motor disabilities. This real-time system design utilizes electromyographic (EMG) biosignals from cranial muscles and electroencephalographic (EEG) biosignals from the cerebrum's occipital lobe, which are transformed into controls for two-dimensional (2-D) cursor movement, the left-click (Enter) command, and an ON/OFF switch for the cursor-control functions. This HCI system classifies biosignals into "mouse" functions by applying amplitude thresholds and performing power spectral density (PSD) estimations on discrete windows of data. Spectral power summations are aggregated over several frequency bands between 8 and 500 Hz and then compared to produce the correct classification. The result is an affordable DSP-based system that, when combined with an on-screen keyboard, enables the user to fully operate a computer without using any extremities.},

abstract = {Word prediction is often recommended by therapists as a means to improve typing speed for clients with physical limitations. Although literature suggests that word prediction does have an effect on writing proficiency, increased speed is not one of its benefits when used with a standard keyboard. One reason given for the failure of word prediction to accelerate typing is that the user must look away from any source document to scan the prediction list during typing. Looking away from the source document may slow the typist more than any acceleration offered by word prediction. For input methods that already require the typist to look away from the copy, this effect might be irrelevant. The focus of this research was to determine whether word completion or word prediction programs would increase typing speed when used with an input method (an on-screen keyboard) that also requires looking away from the source document. Ten people, five men and five women, aged 20 to 38 years, participated in this study. The study used a single-subject, successive intervention design to test typing speed and accuracy using an on-screen keyboard with integrated word prediction software. Seven participants had their fastest typing speed with word prediction. Two participants had their fastest typing speed with word completion. Only one participant demonstrated no improvement in speed when using these two programs. Overall, these results show that the use of word prediction and word completion may assist on-screen keyboard users to improve typing speed.},

The system tracks the computer user's movements with a video camera and translates them into the movements of the mouse pointer on the screen. Body features such as the tip of the user's nose or finger can be tracked. The visual tracking algorithm is based on cropping an online template of the tracked feature from the current image frame and testing where this template correlates in the subsequent frame. The location of the highest correlation is interpreted as the new location of the feature in the subsequent frame. Various body features are examined for tracking robustness and user convenience. A group of 20 people without disabilities tested the Camera Mouse and quickly learned how to use it to spell out messages or play games. Twelve people with severe cerebral palsy or traumatic brain injury have tried the system, nine of whom have shown success.

Fourteen subjects transcribed text with and without a word prediction feature for seven test sessions. Eight subjects were able-bodied and used mouthstick typing, while six subjects had high-level spinal cord injuries and used their usual method of keyboard access. Use of word prediction significantly decreased text generation rate for the spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects and only modestly enhanced it for the able-bodied (AB) subjects. While fewer selections were required with the word prediction system, each selection took significantly longer to make, which we attribute to the additional cognitive and perceptual processes associated with use of word prediction. Performance was further analyzed by deriving subjects' times for keypress and list search actions during word prediction use. All subjects had slower keypress times during word prediction use as compared to letters-only typing, and SCI subjects had much slower list search times than AB subjects. Under the conditions of this experiment, the cognitive cost of using word prediction largely overwhelmed the benefit provided by keystroke savings. SCI subjects appeared to incur higher cognitive costs than AB subjects, possibly due to their prior expertise in letters-only typing.},

Many emergent alternatives to conventional mechanical switches, such as infrared sensing, electromyography, oculography, and computer vision, have been investigated for those retaining some limited volitional motor ability. At the same time, electroencephalography, electrocorticography, intracortical recordings, and electrodermal activity have been explored for those presenting as locked in. The relevant literature is scattered across many disciplines, obfuscating the strength of the clinical evidence in support of the different access technologies currently in development. This article systematically organizes the literature on the aforementioned access technologies, summarizing their underlying operational mechanisms while reviewing the clinical evidence reported between 1996 and 2006. Research evidence within this period is generally found to be at the case study or uncontrolled study level, with very modest sample sizes. Novel mechanical switches and electroencephalography-based access systems dominate the literature, whereas many other movement-based access modalities have emerged with promising early findings. Access methods for those without extant physical movement constitute a critical direction for future and ongoing research efforts.},

Evidence supported the following: (a) different instructional strategies such as building motivation, using errorless learning, or adding video models to picture exchange interventions may improve the acquisition or rate of acquisition of picture exchange mands, (b) limited data supports training mimetic (imitated) or mand signs over tacts and (c) differences in symbol sets and speech output levels appeared to have little effect on AAC-based mand acquisition, but listener-based differences should be considered. These findings have implications for future research and clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Studies that have compared different communication systems for individuals with developmental disabilities were systematically reviewed in an effort to provide information useful for clinical decision making and directions for future research. Specifically, 28 studies that compared (a) non-electronic picture systems to speech generating devices, (b) aided AAC (e.g. picture exchange systems and SGDs) to unaided AAC systems (manual sign), or (c) AAC to speech-language interventions were included in this review. Dependent variables forming the basis for comparison included: (a) effectiveness (e.g. acquisition of systems and/or rate of use), (b) efficiency or rate of skill acquisition (c) participants' preference for systems, (d) occurrence of vocalizations and problem behavior, and (e) generalization across communication partners, settings, and time (i.e. maintenance). Results suggest that clear and consistent differences between communication systems are rare, precluding definitive statements regarding a universal best approach for all people with developmental disabilities. Instead, findings of this review support the consideration of an individual's existing skills, goals and preferences as part of the process of selecting an approach to communication. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper describes our initial efforts toward improving access to situational vocabulary through the use of geographic context to predict vocabulary. A corpus of spoken data produced by one able-bodied male speaker across various locations was collected and used to mine location-specific vocabulary clusters. We describe the data mining algorithm and illustrate how context-driven vocabulary organization and prediction can be integrated into an iconic communication system. Correlations between user and algorithm- generated vocabulary patterns highlight discrepancies between actual versus perceived frequency statistics. Thus, device customization may be achieved through a hybrid human- algorithmic approach to vocabulary selection. Endowing the communication aid with knowledge about the user's location-specific vocabulary patterns may help to balance the burden of communication between the system and the user to yield substantial gains in accessing situationally appropriate vocabulary which may in turn accelerate communication rate.},

A $\backslash$ncomprehensive, quantitative, and accurate model for alternative access systems is needed to $\backslash$noptimize both developers' design decisions and clinicians' system recommendations.

It can be used to predict both task execution and $\backslash$nlearning times, as well as points of excessive long or short term memory load. The GOMS model $\backslash$nis applied here to three interfaces currently used in AAC and computer access systems in order $\backslash$ndescribe and predict user performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The three interfaces $\backslash$nare : (a) row-column letter scanning; (b) row-column letter scanning combined with word prediction $\backslash$nafter the first two letter selections only; and (c) row-column letter scanning combined with word $\backslash$nprediction after each letter selection.

The basic hypothesis is that the estimate of the illuminant is made on the basis of spatial information from the entire visual field. This estimate is then used by the visual system to arrive at an estimate of the (object) reflectance of the various subfields in the complex visual scene. The estimates are made by matching the inputs to the system to linear combinations of fixed bases and standards in the colour space. The model provides a general unified mathematical framework for related psychophysical phenomenology.},

abstract = {Queueing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) is a computational architecture that integrates two complementary approaches to cognitive modeling: the queueing network approach and the symbolic approach (exemplified by the MHP/GOMS family of models, ACT-R, EPIC, and SOAR). Queueing networks are particularly suited for modeling parallel activities and complex structures. Symbolic models have particular strength in generating a person's actions in specific task situations. By integrating the two approaches, QN-MHP offers an architecture for mathematical modeling and real-time generation of concurrent activities in a truly concurrent manner. QN-MHP expands the three discrete serial stages of MHP, of perceptual, cognitive, and motor processing, into three continuous-transmission subnetworks of servers, each performing distinct psychological functions specified with a GOMS-style language. Multitask performance emerges as the behavior of multiple streams of information flowing through a network, with no need to devise complex, task-specific procedures to either interleave production rules into a serial program (ACT-R), or for an executive process to interactively control task processes (EPIC). Using QN-MHP, a driver performance model was created and interfaced with a driving simulator to perform a vehicle steering, and a map reading task concurrently and in real time. The performance data of the model are similar to human subjects performing the same tasks.},

As part of a larger effort to develop software that automatically adapts the configuration of switch access software, data were collected comparing subject performance with a scan rate chosen using the .65 rule and a scan rate chosen by the user. Analysis of the data indicates that for many people, the .65 rule produces a scan rate that is approximately the same as the average switch press time plus 2 standard deviations. Further analysis demonstrates a relationship between the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean) and error rate. If accurate information is available about the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of a client's switch press time, a scan rate can be chosen that will yield a specific error level. If a rigorous statistical approach is impractical, the .65 rule will generally yield a usable scan rate based on mean press time alone.},

The gesture recognition system operates primarily on data from a single 3-axis accelerometer and comprises two main stages: a training stage and a testing stage. For training, the system employs dynamic time warping as well as affinity propagation to create exemplars for each gesture while for testing, the system projects all candidate traces and also the unknown trace onto the same lower dimensional subspace for recognition. A dictionary of 18 gestures is defined and a database of over 3700 traces is created from seven subjects on which the system is tested and evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, our dictionary of gestures is the largest in published studies related to acceleration-based gesture recognition. The system achieves almost perfect user-dependent recognition, and mixed-user and user-independent recognition accuracies that are highly competitive with systems based on statistical methods and with the other accelerometer-based gesture recognition systems available in the literature.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of communication devices such as smartphones has led to the emergence of context-aware services that are able to respond to specific user activities or contexts. These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines. This article presents a survey of the techniques for extracting this activity information from raw accelerometer data. The techniques that can be implemented in mobile devices range from classical signal processing techniques such as FFT to contemporary string-based methods. We present experimental results to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the various techniques using real data sets collected from daily activities.},

abstract = {Time series shapelets are a recent promising concept in time series data mining. Shapelets are time series snippets that can be used to classify unlabeled time series. Shapelets not only provide interpretable results, which are useful for domain experts and developers alike, but shapelet-based classifiers have been shown by several independent research groups to have superior accuracy on many datasets. Moreover, shapelets can be seen as generalizing the lazy nearest neighbor classifier to an eager classifier. Thus, as a deployed classification tool, shapelets can be many orders of magnitude faster than any rival with comparable accuracy. Although shapelets are a useful concept, the current literature bemoans the fact that shapelet discovery is a time-consuming task. In spite of several efforts to speed up shapelet discovery algorithms, including the use of specialist hardware, the current state-of-the-art algorithms are still intractable on large datasets. In this work, we propose a fast shapelet discovery algorithm that outperforms the current state-of-the-art by two or three orders of magnitude, while producing models with accuracy that is not perceptibly different.},

In this paper, we propose a real-time, hierarchical model to recognize both simple gestures and complex activities using a wireless body sensor network. In this model, we first use a fast and lightweight algorithm to detect gestures at the sensor node level, and then propose a pattern based real-time algorithm to recognize complex, high-level activities at the portable device level. We evaluate our algorithms over a real-world dataset. The results show that the proposed system not only achieves good performance (an average utility of 0.81, an average accuracy of 82.87{\%}, and an average real-time delay of 5.7 seconds), but also significantly reduces the network's communication cost by 60.2{\%}. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of the mechanomyogram (MMG) which detects muscular vibrations generated by fused individual fiber twitches has been refined. The study addresses a comparison of the MMG and surface electromyogram (SEMG) in monitoring muscle fatigue. METHODS: The SEMG and MMG were recorded simultaneously from the same territory of motor units in two muscles (Biceps, Brachioradialis) of the human (n = 18), during sustained contraction at 25 {\%} MVC (maximal voluntary contraction). RESULTS: The RMS (root mean square) of the SEMG and MMG increased with advancing fatigue; MF (median frequency) of the PSD (power density spectra) progressively decreased from the onset of the contraction. These findings (both muscles, all subjects), demonstrate both through the SEMG and MMG a central component of the fatigue. The MF regression slopes of MMG were closer to each other between men and women (Biceps 1.55{\%}; Brachialis 13.2{\%}) than were the SEMG MF slopes (Biceps 25.32{\%}; Brachialis 17.72{\%}), which shows a smaller inter-sex variability for the MMG vs. SEMG. CONCLUSION: The study presents another quantitative comparison (MF, RMS) of MMG and SEMG, showing that MMG signal can be used for indication of the degree of muscle activation and for monitoring the muscle fatigue when the application of SEMG is not feasible (chronical implants, adverse environments contaminated by electrical noise).},

abstract = {Scanning communication systems provide a unique set of opportunities for the application of augmentative communication technologies. Possibilities include optimization of the row-column matrix, dynamic rearrangement of the matrix, addition of character or word lists, and combinations of these techniques. A series of descriptive experiments were performed to establish the switch savings performance of 14 different scanning configurations. A common software platform and a strictly regimented testing procedure were employed to ensure the reliability and consistency of the data, facilitating comparisons between the different paradigms. Within each configuration, a systematic analysis of the relevant parameters was performed. The best character prediction method provided an average switch savings of 40.5{\%} over a baseline row-column configuration, while the best word prediction technique provided an average savings of only 38.8{\%}. Both of these configurations used seven-element prediction lists, which did not present any predictions until after selection of the first letter of each word. Additionally, the rowcolumn matrices of these designs were optimized for use with the prediction list such that the more frequently selected matrix entries tended to be in more rapidly accessible matrix locations.},

abstract = {For close to 20 years, clinicians and researchers have been developing and assessing technological interventions for individuals with either acquired impairments or developmental disorders. This paper offers a comprehensive review of literature in that field, which we refer to collectively as assistive technology for cognition (ATC). ATC interventions address a range of func- tional activities requiring cognitive slulls as diverse as complex attention, executive reasoning, prospective memory, self-monitoring for either the enhancement or inhibition of specific behaviours and sequential processing. ATC interventions have also been developed to address the needs of individ- uals with information processing impairments that may affect visual, auditory and language ability, or the understanding of social cues. The literature reviewed indicates that ATC interventions can increase the efficiency of tradi- tional rehabilitation practices by enhancing a person's ability to engage in ther- apeutic tasks independently and by broadening the range of contexts in which those tasks can be exercised. More importantly, for many types of impair- ments, ATC interventions represent entirely new methods of treatment that can reinforce a person's residual intrinsic abilities, provide alternative means by which activities can be completed or provide extrinsic supports so that func- tional activities can be performed that might otherwise not be possible. Although the major focus of research in this field will continue to be the devel- opment of new ATC interventions, over the coming years it will also be critical for researchers, clinicians, and developers to examine the multi-system factors that affect usability over time, generalisability across home and community settings, and the impact of sustained, patterned technological interventions on recovery of function.},

Specifi cally, the paper emphasizes the need to take a more holistic view of communication intervention and highlights the following key principles to guide AAC intervention and research: (a) build on the individual ' s strengths and focus on the integration of skills to maximize communication, (b) focus on the individual ' s participation in real-world contexts, (c) address psychosocial factors as well as skills, and (d) attend to extrinsic environmental factors as well as intrinsic factors related to the individual who requires AAC.},

abstract = {Abstract Facilitated Communication (FC) is a technique whereby individuals with disabilities and communication impairments allegedly select letters by typing on a keyboard while receiving physical support, emotional encouragement, and other communication supports from facilitators. The validity of FC stands or falls on the question of who is authoring the typed messages - the individual with a disability or the facilitator. The International Society for Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ISAAC) formed an Ad Hoc Committee on FC and charged this committee to synthesize the evidence base related to this question in order to develop a position statement. The purpose of this paper is to report this synthesis of the extant peer-reviewed literature on the question of authorship in FC. A multi-faceted search was conducted including electronic database searches, ancestry searches, and contacting selected authors. The authors considered synopses of systematic reviews, and systematic reviews, which were supplemented with individual studies not included in any prior reviews. Additionally, documents submitted by the membership were screened for inclusion. The evidence was classified into articles that provided (a) quantitative experimental data related to the authorship of messages, (b) quantitative descriptive data on the output generated through FC without testing of authorship, (c) qualitative descriptive data on the output generated via FC without testing of authorship, and (d) anecdotal reports in which writers shared their perspectives on FC. Only documents with quantitative experimental data were analyzed for authorship. Results indicated unequivocal evidence for facilitator control: messages generated through FC are authored by the facilitators rather than the individuals with disabilities. Hence, FC is a technique that has no validity.},

The aim of the present study was to examine the impact of SGD mentoring on the mentees' SGD usage. Three mentors, aged 23, 31, and 54 years, and 3 mentees, aged 13, 14, and 32 years, participated. A nonconcurrent multiple baseline across participants design was used to assess the outcomes. Mentee conversation samples were analyzed for the number of total words, the number of different words, and the number of bound morphemes produced in mentoring sessions. Improvements were made in these measures across the mentees following commencement of mentoring sessions with a trained SGD mentor. These results provide preliminary evidence of SGD mentoring success.

Sixteen infants (mean = 10.6 months) without disabilities participated in two storybook reading interactions with an experimenter in two conditions where the AAC system was either aligned or divided from the experimenter's eye gaze. Individual differences in JA skills, caregiver JA style, and temperament were associated with coordinated JA across both conditions. The findings suggest it is important to examine both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, which may not only reduce attention demands but also mediate the success of JA interactions with AAC systems.},

The goal of these two pilot experiments was to examine differences in conversational performance of adults with Alzheimer's disease related to the presence and absence of an aid, the type of symbol embedded in the aid, and the presence or absence of voice output. In Experiment 1, 30 adults with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease participated in 10-min conversations with and without personalized AAC boards. There was no effect of AAC, regardless of symbol type, and a deleterious effect of voice output. In Experiment 2, modified spaced-retrieval training preceded conversations, standardized prompts were presented, and semantically-based dependent variables were examined. For the 11 participants in the second experiment, there was a significant effect of AAC, showing that the presence of AAC was associated with greater use of targeted words during personal conversations. We discuss new information about the contribution of AAC for persons with Alzheimer's disease, and demonstrate how the applied research process evolves over the course of a long-term commitment to a scientific investigation.},

abstract = {The purposes of this review were to (a) use meta-analytic procedures to examine the effectiveness of single-case AAC intervention research on challenging behaviors exhibited by individuals with disabilities, (b) identify study characteristics that moderate intervention effects, and (c) evaluate the quality of research. The authors provided inferential and descriptive analyses of 54 studies representing 111 participants and estimated effect sizes using the Nonoverlap of All Pairs (NAP) method. Overall, AAC interventions were found to be equally effective across a broad spectrum of participants and interventions. AAC interventions were more effective with younger children than with adults. Interventions in which functional behavior assessments (FBA) were used had significantly larger effect sizes than those that did not use FBAs. Further, functional communication training interventions resulted in larger effect sizes than Picture Exchange Communication System interventions. Descriptive analysis revealed that (a) interventions often occurred in atypical environments (e.g., therapy room, experimental room) and with atypical interventionists (e.g., therapists, researchers), and (b) numerous studies did not exhibit quality characteristics of single-case research.},

abstract = {It is with great excitement that we are assuming our roles as co-editors of the journal, Augmentative and Alternative Communication. As we embark on this new journey, we would like to take a moment to consider the enormous changes that have taken place in the field of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) over the past four decades and to reflect on the future challenges that lie ahead if we are to attain our mission of enhancing communication for all people with complex communication needs. Thirty to 40 years ago, people with complex communication needs typically lived in large institutions, isolated from the community (Col- lier {\&} Self, 2010; Mirenda, 1993). AAC interventions were the exception rather than the rule, typically imple- mented only after years of traditional speech therapy had produced little benefit, and often reserved only for those individuals who were judged to have the necessary “prerequisite” skills (Estrella, 2000). Since these early days of AAC, the field has witnessed dramatic changes: changes in the demographics of the population that uses AAC; changes in the scope of communication needs that must be considered; changes in the AAC systems that are available; and, ultimately, changes in expecta- tions for participation by individuals who use AAC.

The response rates of special pre-school training centers and special schools were 59{\%} and 71{\%}, respectively. The response rate of adult settings was 18{\%}. Results indicated that a higher proportion of students identified as having complex communication needs had access to AAC service provision in schools for children with intellectual and physical disabilities than those in special pre-school training centres and other types of special schools. Generalization of AAC service beyond the classroom setting remains problematic. Seventy-two percent of the respondents were dissatisfied with the training in AAC that they received during their basic professional preparation. More advocacy work is needed to increase awareness and knowledge of AAC use in Hong Kong.},

abstract = {Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) evidence-based practice requires the collection and analysis of performance data. This article presents the development, evaluation, and application of automated performance monitoring tools for use in clinical practice. Language activity monitoring (LAM) is the systematic data collection of the actual language activity of an individual who relies on AAC. Work completed to date includes the development and evaluation of the language activity monitor function, which now is commercially available in three forms: (1) a standard feature built into modern high performance AAC systems, (2) an external add-on package for use with older AAC devices based on synthetic speech, and (3) software that allows the personal computer to serve as an LAM in the clinical environment. The LAM records the time and content of language events (the generation of one or more letters or words). A logging protocol suitable for clinical application has been in use since late 1998. The logged data is uploaded periodically to a computer for editing, analysis, and the generation of a summary measure report. The applications of this work in the areas of clinical service delivery are presented.},

The purpose of this study was to determine how technology users decide to accept or reject assistive devices. Two hundred twenty-seven adults with various disabilities responded to a survey on device selection, acquisition, performance, and use. Results showed that 29.3{\%} of all devices were completely abandoned. Mobility aids were more frequently abandoned than other categories of devices, and abandonment rates were highest during the first year and after 5 years of use. Four factors were significantly related to abandonment--lack of consideration of user opinion in selection, easy device procurement, poor device performance, and change in user needs or priorities. These findings suggest that technology-related policies and services need to emphasize consumer involvement and long-term needs of consumers to reduce device abandonment and enhance consumer satisfaction.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article presents the results of a meta-analysis to determine the effect of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) on the speech production of individuals with developmental disabilities. Method: A comprehensive search of the literature published between 1975 and 2003, which included data on speech production before, during, and after AAC intervention, was conducted using a combination of electronic and hand searches. Results: The review identified 23 studies, involving 67 individuals. Seventeen of these studies did not establish experimental control, thereby limiting the certainty of evidence about speech outcomes. The remaining 6 studies, involving 27 cases, had sufficient methodological rigor for the ‘‘best evidence analysis'' (cf. R. E. Slavin, 1986). Most of the participants (aged 2–60 years) had mental retardation or autism; the AAC interventions involved instruction in manual signs or nonelectronic aided systems.None of the 27 cases demonstrated decreases in speech production as a result of AAC intervention, 11{\%} showed no change, and the majority (89{\%}) demonstrated gains in speech. For the most part, the gains observed were modest, but these data may underestimate the effect of AAC intervention on speech production because there were ceiling effects. Conclusions: Future research is needed to better delineate the relationship between AACintervention and speech production across awider range of participants andAAC interventions.},

Two tasks, an identification task and a preference task, were administered sequentially and individually. The results of this study suggest: (1) typical adults' preference between PCSs and GCSs did not show any significant difference; (2) the effect of age groups of typical adults did not have any significant effect on their preference between PCSs and GCSs. However, except the group of ages 51-65, the other three groups did consciously show their preferences for PCSs.

abstract = {There are many people who find the standard computer input devices—the keyboard and mouse—difficult to use due to a motor disability. A number of keyboard and mouse configuration options designed to overcome physical difficulties exist. However, formal empirical evaluation of such facilities is rare. There is, in fact, little data available on the precise nature of physical difficulties with input devices. Hence, it is difficult to gauge the adequacy of existing access provision. This paper presents an empirical study of the keyboard and mouse errors encountered in a sample of 20 computer users with motor disabilities, and six without disabilities. Six important classes of keyboard difficulty are identified, involving significant correction time for participants with disabilities. Difficulties with all aspects of mouse usage were observed, particularly pointing and dragging. Many of the difficulties observed would be amenable to automatic detection. It is hoped that these results will help to inform the development of more accessible software and hardware.},

For example, a computer can allow someone with severe speech and motor-impairment to engage more fully with the world.

Currently, a low cost interface suitable for different types of motor-impaired users is hardly available. Additionally, the target audience of existing such systems is very much limited. The present work solved these problems by its adaptation mechanism. The adaptation mechanism provides an appropriate interface from an interface bank for each user before start of an interaction. The adaptation mechanism is continued during as well as after the end of interactions to make the system personalized to individual user.},

abstract = {Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices include special purpose electronic devices that generate speech output and are used by individuals to augment or replace vocal communication. Word prediction, including context specific prediction, has been proposed to help overcome barriers to the use of these devices (e.g., slow communication rates and limited access to situation-related vocabulary), but has not been tested in terms of effects during actual task performance. In this study, we compared AAC device use, task performance, and user perceptions across three tasks, in conditions where the AAC device used either was, or was not, primed with task specific vocabularies. The participants in this study were adults with normal physical, cognitive, and communication abilities. Context priming had a marginally significant effect on AAC device use as measured by keystroke savings; however, these advantages did not translate into higher level measures of rate, task performance, or user perceptions. In contrast, there were various statistically significant process and performance differences across task type. Additionally, results for two different emulations of human performance showed significant keystroke savings across context conditions. However, these effects were mitigated in actual performance and did not translate into keystroke savings. This indicates to AAC device designers and users that keystroke-based measures of device use may not be predictive of high level performance.},

Eight participants aged 8;11-20;08 years (mean 16;02 years) participated in the study. Three pause time conditions (2, 10, and 45 seconds) were trialled during a scripted shared storybook reading task. A total of 27 turn opportunities were provided for participants during the task. Participant interactions were analysed for the percentage of responses made to a turn opportunity, mean length of utterance in words (MLU), percentage of assertive conversational acts made, and the modes of communication used. Findings indicated that participants were more likely to respond to a turn opportunity when their communication partner provided a longer pause time. Additionally, a longer pause time resulted in longer MLUs. Participants did not use more assertive conversational acts and continued to use a variety of communication modes when provided with a longer pause time. Results indicate that increasing pause time is an effective strategy to support the development of expressive communication for young people who use AAC. This suggests the need for professionals providing AAC services to encourage communication partners to provide extended pauses during interactions.},

abstract = {Four brands of electronic communication devices and three input selection methods were compared in terms of speed and accuracy. Sixteen able-bodied subjects (college students) used one of eight possible device/input method combinations to copy text or engage in a scripted interactive communication task. The printed outputs were analyzed for the number of words generated and the number of errors made. The electronic communication devices included the Equalizer, the EvalPAC, the ScanWRITER, and the Apple Macintosh with Screentyper software. The input selection methods included row-column scanning with a single switch, directed scanning using a joystick, and direct selection/access using head control. Analyses of the subjects' printed outputs, produced following short-term training, showed that the input selection method was a significant factor in text input rate for both text copying and interactive communication. The input method had no significant effect, however, on accuracy during either text copying or interactive communication. Surprisingly, the specific electronic communication device had little or no significant effect on rate or accuracy when the input selection method was the same. Direct selection using the EvalPAC's head mounted light pointer was by far the fastest of the device/input method combinations tested. For some of the communication devices examined, joystick control of the cursor was more rapid or accurate than single switch row-column scanning. Error types and frequencies of their occurrence were similar for both text copying and interactive communication tasks. The two most common types of errors were the insertion or omission of characters or spaces.},

With respect to communication strategies, it was found that formal communication partners thought that more vocabulary for communicating social purposes was actually available to AAC users and they were less aware of daily routines within day and residential environments. With respect to advantages and disadvantages, three main areas of concern emerged: the effect of the AAC system on the users' communication; features of AAC systems; and the effect of AAC on the users' quality of life. Both high- and low-technology AAC systems were seen as having advantages and disadvantages. This study demonstrates the important contribution to be made by AAC users in the provision of a new set of priorities based on their user experiences.},

abstract = {Children with severe motor impairments who cannot use direct selection are typically introduced to scanning as a means of accessing assistive technology. Unfortunately, it is difficult for young children to learn to scan because the design of current scanning techniques does not always make explicit the offer of items from the selection array; furthermore, it does not provide explicit feedback after activation of the switch to select the target item. In the current study, scanning was redesigned to reduce learning demands by making both the offer of items and the feedback upon selection more explicit through the use of animation realized through HTML and speech output with appropriate intonation. Twenty typically developing 2-year-olds without disabilities were randomly assigned to use either traditional scanning or enhanced scanning to select target items from an array of three items. The 2-year-olds did not learn to use traditional scanning across three sessions. Their performance in Session 3 did not differ from that in Session 1; they did not exceed chance levels of accuracy in either session (mean accuracy of 20{\%} for Sessions 1 and 3). In contrast, the children in the enhanced scanning condition demonstrated improvements in accuracy across the three 10-20-min sessions (mean accuracies of 22 and 48{\%} for Sessions 1 and 3, respectively). There were no reliable differences between the children's performances with the two scanning techniques for Session 1; however, by Session 3, the children were more than twice as accurate using the enhanced scanning technique compared to the traditional design. Results suggest that by redesigning scanning, we may be able to reduce some of the learning demands and thereby reduce some of the instructional time required for children to attain mastery. Clinical implications, limitations, and directions for future research and development are discussed.},

abstract = {Beukelman (1991) introduced the concept of the magic versus the cost of communicative competence in AAC. Fundamentally, this refers to the relative effort that must be exerted (the cost) in order for AAC to be a viable communication mode (the magic). Many clinicians have seen the magic for clients who are truly successful in using AAC; such successes have also been documented in the literature. Yet until AAC is successful with each and every client for whom it is implemented, it is necessary to continue to identify barriers to its effective use. In the same year, Light and Lindsay (1991) argued for consideration of principles of cognitive science in constructing maximally useful AAC symbol arrays. In the current paper, we consider how knowledge from one area of cognitive science, that of visual cognition, might be integrated into AAC symbol array construction. We review four areas of visual cognition that might relate to the construction of AAC displays:(a) organization of stimulus arrays within either grids (row-column configuration) or integrated within natural scenes, (b) symbol location, (c) color and contrast, and (d) symmetry and axial orientation.

However, there is the danger that the excitement over these new devices will result in a misplaced focus on the technology, to the neglect of what must be the central focus - the people with complex communication needs who require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In order to truly harness the power of technology, rehabilitation and educational professionals must ensure that AAC intervention is driven, not by the devices, but rather by the communication needs of the individual. Furthermore, those involved in AAC research and development activities must ensure that the design of AAC technologies is driven by an understanding of motor, sensory, cognitive, and linguistic processing, in order to minimize learning demands and maximize communication power for individuals with complex communication needs across the life span.},

abstract = {Aided augmentative and alternative (AAC) interventions have been demonstrated to facilitate a variety of communication outcomes in persons with intellectual disabilities. Most aided AAC systems rely on a visual modality. When the medium for communication is visual, it seems likely that the effectiveness of intervention depends in part on the effectiveness and efficiency with which the information presented in the display can be perceived, identified, and extracted by communicators and their partners. Understanding of visual-cognitive processing - that is, how a user attends, perceives, and makes sense of the visual information on the display - therefore seems critical to designing effective aided AAC interventions. In this Forum Note, we discuss characteristics of one particular type of aided AAC display, that is, Visual Scene Displays (VSDs) as they may relate to user visual and cognitive processing. We consider three specific ways in which bodies of knowledge drawn from the visual cognitive sciences may be relevant to the composition of VSDs, with the understanding the direct research with children with complex communication needs is necessary to verify or refute our speculations.},

Language barriers and disabilities that affect communication have been shown to decrease quality of care. We sought to assess whether communication problems are associated with an increased risk of preventable adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We randomly selected 20 general hospitals in the province of Quebec with at least 1500 annual admissions. Of the 145,672 admissions to the selected hospitals in 2000/01, we randomly selected and reviewed 2355 charts of patients aged 18 years or older. Reviewers abstracted patient characteristics, including communication problems, and details of hospital admission, and assessed the cause and preventability of identified adverse events. The primary outcome was adverse events.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 217 adverse events, 63 (29{\%}) were judged to be preventable, for an overall population rate of 2.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.1{\%}-3.4{\%}). We found that patients with preventable adverse events were significantly more likely than those without such events to have a communication problem (odds ratio [OR] 3.00; 95{\%} CI 1.43-6.27) or a psychiatric disorder (OR 2.35; 95{\%} CI 1.09-5.05). Patients who were admitted urgently were significantly more likely than patients whose admissions were elective to experience an event (OR 1.64, 95{\%} CI 1.07-2.52). Preventable adverse events were mainly due to drug errors (40{\%}) or poor clinical management (32{\%}). We found that patients with communication problems were more likely than patients without these problems to experience multiple preventable adverse events (46{\%} v. 20{\%}; p = 0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Patients with communication problems appeared to be at highest risk for preventable adverse events. Interventions to reduce the risk for these patients need to be developed and evaluated.},

abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the research regarding communication between nurses and patients with complex communication needs (CCN). The research was reviewed with respect to the following themes: (a) the importance of communication; (b) the barriers to effective communication; (c) the supports needed for effective communication; and (d) recommendations for improving the effectiveness of communication between nurses and patients with CCN. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies that can be used by nurses to facilitate more effective communication with patients with CCN are discussed. BACKGROUND: Effective nurse-patient communication is critical to efficient care provision. Difficulties in communication between nurses and patients arise when patients are unable to speak. This problem is further complicated because nurses typically receive little or no training in how to use AAC to communicate with patients with CCN. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHOD: This paper reviewed the published research focusing on the perspectives of nurses, patients with CCN and their caregivers regarding the challenges to effective communication between nurses and patients with CCN. Further, specific strategies (i.e., using AAC) that nurses can use to improve and facilitate communication with patients with CCN are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Communication between nurses and patients is critical to providing and receiving quality care. Nurses and patients have reported concern and frustration when communication is not adequate. Using AAC strategies will help nurses and patients better communicate with each other when speech is not an option. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Communication with all patients is very important to the provision of quality nursing care. Communication cannot always be achieved using the speech modality. Nurses need to have tools and skills that will allow them to communicate with all of their patients whether or not they can speak.},

Yet to date there are no reports of empirical interventions that investigate or demonstrate an improvement in communication in hospital for these patients. The aim of this review was to synthesize the findings of research into communication in hospital for people with severe communication disabilities arising from lifelong and acquired stable conditions including cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, aphasia following stroke, but excluding progressive conditions and those solely related to sensory impairments of hearing or vision. Results revealed six core strategies suggested to improve communication in hospital: (a) develop services, systems, and policies that support improved communication, (b) devote enough time to communication, (c) ensure adequate access to communication tools (nurse call systems and communication aids), (d) access personally held written health information, (e) collaborate effectively with carers, spouses, and parents, and (f) increase the communicative competence of hospital staff. Currently there are no reports that trial or validate any of these strategies specifically in hospital settings. Observational and evaluative research is needed to investigate the ecological validity of strategies proposed to improve communication.},

abstract = {This paper describes USE-IT, a knowledge-based tool for automating the design of interactions at the physical level, so as to ensure accessibility of the target user interface by different user groups, including people with disabilities. To achieve this, USE-IT elicits, manipulates and interprets representations of design knowledge in order to reason about, select and decide upon lexical adaptation constituents of a user interface. Adaptation constituents are attributes of abstract interaction object classes. USE-IT generates a collection of adaptation rules (i.e. a lexical specification scenario), based on design constraints generated from three basic knowledge sources: (a) the user model, (b) the task schema, and (c) a set of platform constraints (i.e. interaction objects, attributes, device availability, etc.). A data structure called the adaptability model tree has been designed to (i) facilitate the development of plausible semantics of adaptation at the lexical level of interaction, (ii) allow unification of design constraints, and (iii) enable selection of maximally preferred design options. The output of USE-IT can be subsequently interpreted by the run-time libraries of a high-level user interface development toolkit, which provides the required implementation support for realizing the user-adapted interface on a target platform.},

abstract = {We report on an investigation into people's behaviors on information search tasks, specifically the relation between eye movement patterns and task characteristics. We conducted two independent user studies (n = 32 and n = 40), one with journalism tasks and the other with genomics tasks. The tasks were constructed to represent information needs of these two different users groups and to vary in several dimensions according to a task classification scheme. For each participant we classified eye gaze data to construct models of their reading patterns. The reading models were analyzed with respect to the effect of task types and Web page types on reading eye movement patterns. We report on relationships between tasks and individual reading behaviors at the task and page level. Specifically we show that transitions between scanning and reading behavior in eye movement patterns and the amount of text processed may be an implicit indicator of the current task type facets. This may be useful in building user and task models that can be useful in personalization of information systems and so address design demands driven by increasingly complex user actions with information systems. One of the contributions of this research is a new methodology to model information search behavior and investigate information acquisition and cognitive processing in interactive information tasks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This controller is able to share the information provided by the local motion planning level with the commands issued sparsely by the user.

Users whose expectations are unmet by the interface will tend to abandon it. In this paper we present a vision-based interface for motor-impaired users; a multidisciplinary group developed this interface. The user's preferences are a critical issue when selecting an access device; therefore, user requirements should be included in the design. Usability evaluation should be integrated into relevant phases of software development. In order to evaluate the design, we present a process with multiple user studies at different development stages. We describe the combination of a development project and its implementation, with user experience considerations embedded in the process. Finally, we studied the performance of the interface through several tests, paying special attention to satisfaction and fatigue. From our results we observed that although several users found the interface tiring, their satisfaction level was encouraging, suggesting the interface is usable. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, an assessment of a driving assistance by a deictic command for a smart wheelchair is proposed. This equipment enables the user to move with a series of indications on an interface displaying a view of the environment and bringing about automatic movement of the wheelchair. Two sets of tests were implemented to assess the advantages of this type of assistance compared with conventional wheelchair control. The first set evaluated the performance of the human-machine system that is based on a course time analysis, an observation of users' actions, and an estimation of driving comfort. The second test was implemented to assess the cognitive requirements of the driving task, specifically the attentional and executive processes required when driving in assisted mode. A dual-task method was used to achieve this. The results show that driving assistance brings about a decrease in physical load for the same level of comfort as manual driving, but requires an additional cognitive effort for the user, especially in terms of executive abilities.},

abstract = {Towards a Common Language for Functioning , Disability and Health ICFThe International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, known more commonly as ICF, provides a standard language and framework for the description of health and health-related states. Like the first version published by the World Health Organization for trial purposes in 1980, ICF is a multipurpose classification intended for a wide range of uses in different sectors. It is a classification of health and health-related domains -- domains that help us to describe changes in body function and structure, what a person with a health condition can do in a standard environment (their level of capacity), as well as what they actually do in their usual environment (their level of performance). These domains are classified from body, individual and societal perspectives by means of two lists: a list of body functions and structure, and a list of domains of activity and participation. In ICF, the term functioning refers to all body functions, activities and participation, while disability is similarly an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. ICF also lists environmental factors that interact with all these components. ICF},

This lack of customization may limit technology adoption and social integration. This paper describes our efforts to generate personalized synthesis for users with profoundly limited speech motor control. Existing voice banking and voice conversion techniques rely on recordings of clearly articulated speech from the target talker, which cannot be obtained from this population. Our VocaliD approach extracts prosodic properties from the target talker's source function and applies these features to a surrogate talker's database, generating a synthetic voice with the vocal identity of the target talker and the clarity of the surrogate talker. Promising intelligibility results suggest areas of further development for improved personalization.},

abstract = {Thirty-four informal caregivers who support 26 persons with ALS reported on AAC technology use. Each caregiver completed the Communication Device Use Checklist, a survey tool developed for this study based on Light's (1988) classification of the purposes of social interaction (Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 4, 66-82). The checklist includes 17 purposes of communication and asks participants to judge importance, mode, and frequency of use for each purpose. Results show that the three communication purposes used most frequently and valued as important by caregivers involve regulating the behavior of others for basic needs and wants (getting needs met; giving instructions or directions to others; and clarifying needs). Consistent reports of use and frequency for the purposes of staying connected (social closeness) and discussing important issues (information transfer) indicate that AAC technology can assist the dyad in maintaining previous relationships. The face-to-face spontaneous conversation mode is used most frequently, despite the slow rate of production, the lack of permanence, and the demands on conversational partners during message generation. Clinical and research implications are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the epidemiologic characteristics of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Brazil in 1998. METHOD: Structured Clinical Report Forms (CRFs) sent to 2,505 Brazilian neurologists from January to September 1998 to be filled with demographic and clinical data regarding any ALS patient seen at any time during that year. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty CRFs were returned by 168 neurologists. Data on 443 patients meeting the criteria of probable or definite ALS according to El Escorial definition were analysed: 63 probable (14.2{\%}) and 380 definite (85. 8{\%}). Two hundred and fifty-nine (58.5{\%}) of the patients were male, mean age of onset was 52. Spinal onset occurred in 306 patients (69{\%}); bulbar onset in 82 (18.5{\%}), and both in 52 (11.7{\%}). Twenty-six (5.9{\%}) had a family history of ALS. Two hundred and fifty-nine (58.6{\%}) were seen by private practitioners, and 178 (40. 2{\%}) at a hospital clinic. Age-ajusted incidence shows a peak incidence at the 65-74 years old range. CONCLUSIONS: The disease's characteristics are similar to those described in international studies, except for age of onset (Brazilian patients are younger). This difference is not confirmed when figures are age-adjusted.},

abstract = {Intervention incorporating augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is often implemented with adults with aphasia, although studies do not always specify the approaches and strategies used. This study examined abilities of three individuals with chronic non-fluent aphasia (NA) using a dynamic display AAC device to enhance communication. The device, Dialect with Speaking Dynamically Pro, was tailored to each participant's skill level using a treatment protocol adapted from Koul, Corwin, and Hayes (2005). The primary caregiver was the spouse. Pre and post-treatment measures revealed improvement in quality and effectiveness of communication for all participants. Improved linguistic and cognitive functioning was observed for two participants. Results are discussed relative to use of a device with other adults with chronic NA.},

Principle 1 requires the active participation of individuals with complex communication needs (CCN) in all AAC activities. Principle 2 seeks to ensure that theoretical constructs underlying research and development in AAC are grounded, widely accepted, and clearly defined. Principle 3 underscores the need to use ergonomics in the design and development of AAC technologies and instructional strategies. Principle 4 highlights communication partners and the unique roles they play in AAC. Principle 5 accentuates the need to focus on societal roles, relationships, and opportunities made possible by AAC technologies and services. Finally, principle 6 draws attention to the importance of measuring a broad range of AAC outcomes, especially those most significant to primary AAC stakeholders.},

abstract = {The success of communicative interaction is dependent on the communication skills of each individual participating in the exchange. Accordingly, in the case of an interaction involving an individual using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), the success of the interaction depends not only on the skills of this individual, but also on those of the communication partner. Current literature indicates that communication partner instruction is a critical intervention component. Furthermore, there is evidence that, with instruction, communication partners can learn to use facilitative interaction skills and strategies to better support the communication of individuals using AAC. To date, however, little attention has been paid to the most effective and efficient instructional methods for communication partner intervention programs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an eight-step strategic model for use in communication partner instruction programs, and identify future research directions related...},

abstract = {This article highlights the importance of the information obtained from the family in the implementation of the augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system. The objective was to investigate the communicative abilities of children with severe communication deficit through their parents' reports within the family routine. Eleven parents of children affiliated with a rehabilitation program in a public university in Brazil participated in this research. Per their parents' reports, the children demonstrated a variety of communication skills related to comprehension, expressive skills, and vocabulary. Parents further reported their children's daily communication routines including social partners, communication environment, and the materials the children enjoyed the most. These results emphasize the importance of family involvement in planning AAC so that it is functional within the family context. (copyright) Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2012.},

Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) picture communication may provide a standard communication strategy for postoperative children and facilitate nurse-patient communication. The study purposes were to (1) determine if inconsistency exists between nurse assessments of pain location versus identification of pain location using AAC picture communication aids and (2) determine parent satisfaction with use of AAC picture communication aids. A convenience sample of patients aged 3 to 9 years were recruited in a Midwestern freestanding pediatric hospital's postanesthesia care unit (PACU). The patient's pain location was assessed using an AAC picture communication aid and compared with the PACU nurses' pain assessment. Nurses did not consistently document location of pain, and, when documented, the surgical site was inaccurately identified as the location of pain. Parent satisfaction was measured through completion of a 10-item satisfaction survey. Respondents were satisfied with the use of AAC picture communication aids. ?? 2011 American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.},
